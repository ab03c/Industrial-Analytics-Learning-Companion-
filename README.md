# 🎯 Industrial-Analytics-Learning-Companion

## Overview
The Industrial Analytics Learning Companion is an AI-powered educational tool designed to help students in ISE 519 learn SQL and Power BI through proactive, guided instruction. Instead of simply answering questions, the model anticipates student needs by generating realistic, industry-inspired datasets and prompting clarifying questions that simulate real analytical workflows. By bridging classroom concepts with real-world supply chain, manufacturing, and process-improvement scenarios, the tool enables students to practice end-to-end data analysis from cleaning messy data to generating KPIs and writing SQL queries ultimately building stronger, career-ready analytical skills. By bridging the gap between theoretical coursework and real-world industrial applications particularly in supply chain analytics, manufacturing operations, and process improvement, this tool enables students to gain hands-on experience, apply course concepts effectively, and build career-ready skills.

## Objective
The objective of this project is to build an interactive AI tool that delivers structured, step-by-step learning in industrial analytics. It is designed especially for students with limited exposure to industry who are still exploring the different functions within each domain and the critical analytics used to evaluate them. The tool guides learners as they navigate to the domain and function of their choice, tailors relevant KPIs and SQL queries, adjusts difficulty levels, and explains the reasoning behind each step helping them build confidence and practical understanding as they develop their analytical skills.

## Tech Stack
- Custom GPT framework 

## How to Use the AI Tool
1. Access the tool via the link - https://chatgpt.com/g/g-69325ec27d7481919c698564d8d58cbb-industrial-analytics-learning-companion
2. Select any conversation starter from the interface to begin exploring a domain.
3. Answer the guided questions to specify your preferences, such as domain, function, user intent, and skill level.
4. Review the step-by-step analytical plan generated by the tool, including tailored KPIs, SQL queries, and reasoning.

## Configuration
To recreate the Industrial Analytics Learning Companion using OpenAI’s Custom GPT framework, follow the steps below:

1. Open ChatGPT- Start by navigating to the Explore tab in ChatGPT and selecting Create a GPT. Give your model a clear name (e.g., Industrial Analytics Learning Companion) and a concise description that reflects its purpose.

2. In the Configure panel, add detailed instructional logic under 'Instructions' that defines:
How the GPT should ask clarifying questions
How it should guide students step-by-step
How it should tailor KPIs, domains, functions, and SQL queries
How to adjust responses based on skill level and explain reasoning
(These instructions are provided in the Phase-2 folder.) 

3. Add a list of conversation starters that reflect common student queries. These starters help orient first-time users and expose them to different functions and domains.

4. In the 'Knowledge' section, upload the relevant materials that the GPT should reference. This enables the GPT to anchor its recommendations in structured, domain-relevant knowledge.

5. Under 'Recommended Model', choose GPT 5 Thinking to ensure strong reasoning, contextual understanding, and SQL generation accuracy. These models provide the most reliable step-by-step explanations and domain mapping for analytical tasks.

6. Once all configurations, instructions, conversation starters, and knowledge files are added, click 'Create' to finalize your custom GPT. You can then make it private, share it via link, or publish it for broader use.

## Next Steps
1. Introduce messy, real-world datasets including missing values, inconsistencies, and fragmented tables to help students practice realistic data cleaning and preparation workflows.
2. Add interactive SQL and analytics quizzes to help students assess their understanding at different skill levels.
3. Improve conversation flows to make guidance more intuitive, context-aware, and aligned with how students naturally explore analytical problems.
4. Expand the library of scenarios and KPIs to broaden the tool’s coverage and practical relevance.
