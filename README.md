# 🎯 Industrial-Analytics-Learning-Companion

## 📘 Objective
This project aims to develop a proactive, OpenAI-powered recommendation tool to enhance the practical learning experience of ISE 519: Database Applications in Industrial and Systems Engineering, with a focus on SQL and Power BI. Unlike traditional reactive models, the custom GPT will serve as a guided learning companion, generating realistic, industry-relevant datasets that incorporate common data challenges such as fragmentation, incompleteness, and inconsistency. The model will coach students step-by-step through cleaning, integrating, and analyzing these datasets, offering tailored guidance, clarifying questions, and actionable recommendations. By bridging the gap between theoretical coursework and real-world industrial applications particularly in supply chain analytics, manufacturing operations, and process improvement, this tool enables students to gain hands-on experience, apply course concepts effectively, and build career-ready skills.
