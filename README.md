# 🎯 Industrial-Analytics-Learning-Companion

## 📘 Summary
A custom GPT designed to help students of ISE 519 learn SQL, Power BI, and industrial analytics through proactive recommendations and realistic industry scenarios.

## 📘 Overview
The Industrial Analytics Learning Companion is an AI-powered educational tool designed to help students in ISE 519 learn SQL and Power BI through proactive, guided instruction. Instead of simply answering questions, the model anticipates student needs by generating realistic, industry-inspired datasets and prompting clarifying questions that simulate real analytical workflows. By bridging classroom concepts with real-world supply chain, manufacturing, and process-improvement scenarios, the tool enables students to practice end-to-end data analysis—from cleaning messy data to generating KPIs and writing SQL queries—ultimately building stronger, career-ready analytical skills. By bridging the gap between theoretical coursework and real-world industrial applications particularly in supply chain analytics, manufacturing operations, and process improvement, this tool enables students to gain hands-on experience, apply course concepts effectively, and build career-ready skills.

## 📘 Objective
The objective of this project is to build an interactive AI tool that delivers structured, step-by-step learning in industrial analytics. It is designed especially for students with limited exposure to industry who are still exploring the different functions within each domain and the critical analytics used to evaluate them. The tool guides learners as they navigate to the domain and function of their choice, tailors relevant KPIs and SQL queries, adjusts difficulty levels, and explains the reasoning behind each step helping them build confidence and practical understanding as they develop their analytical skills.
